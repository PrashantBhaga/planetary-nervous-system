🌍 Planetary Nervous System (PNS)

Imagine a world where the Earth could sense environmental changes, coordinate responses, and heal itself—just like your body does. The Planetary Nervous System (PNS) is a groundbreaking project turning this vision into reality. By combining cutting-edge technology with decentralized, community-driven solutions, PNS creates a self-organizing network that mirrors the planet’s natural intelligence.

🌟 Core Vision: A Nervous System for the Earth

Inspired by how forests connect through underground mycorrhizal networks and how your body responds to injuries, PNS enables Earth to:
	•	Sense environmental conditions in real-time.
	•	Coordinate resources to solve problems.
	•	Heal ecosystems through collective action.
